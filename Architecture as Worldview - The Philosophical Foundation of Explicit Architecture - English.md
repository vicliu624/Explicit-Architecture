**Release Date**: October 2025  
--------------------

## Chapter 1: Everything Begins with Distinction

### 1.1. The Essence of Software: A Neglected Question

In the history of software engineering, we repeatedly fall into the trap of "**tool-first**":
New frameworks and technologies emerge endlessly, yet few people ask a more fundamental question:

> **What is the essence of software?**

We are proficient in using MVC, Spring Boot, React, Kubernetes, and enthusiastic about microservices, Serverless, and AI-generated code;
But these do not answer "what software is." Most engineers are trained to be tool users, not world interpreters.

The goal of this article is to **return to the philosophical starting point of software** and clarify the following questions:

- Why "software" as a thing emerged;
- The ontological status of software in reality;
- Why "distinction" and "interpretation" are more fundamental than "code" and "tools"
- Why high-level architectural cognition is difficult to replace with AI.

------

### 1.2. The Trap of "Tool-First"

#### 1.2.1 Concept

The so-called "tool-first" refers to teams focusing first on **technology/framework/tool selection and usage**, rather than first understanding **business, domain, and problem essence**.

> Buy a hammer first, then look for nails.
> Tools define problems, rather than problems selecting tools.

The result is:

1. Software is simplified to "implementation" rather than "a medium for interpreting the world";
2. Tools and frameworks replace architectural and modeling thinking;
3. Domain logic is buried in technical details, weakening evolvability and semantic clarity.

------

#### 1.2.2 Manifestations in Engineering Practice

- **Technology selection priority**: First decide on Spring Boot/React/Kafka, then supplement business modeling;
- **Framework kidnapping business**: Bounded contexts are replaced by CRUD microservices;
- **Emphasizing implementation over modeling**: Write Controller/Repository first, then think "what problem are we solving";
- **Depending on tools rather than principles**: Architectural logic is driven by ORM/message queues, not domain semantics.

------

#### 1.2.3 Typical Bad Phenomena in the Industry

| Phenomenon | Surface Practice | Cognitive Stagnation | Engineering Consequences |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Java EE / Spring Boot**<br>Frameworks "define" system structure, not domain models | Developers take Controller/Service/Repository three-layer as natural boundaries | Mistaking framework default structure for domain structure, no longer actively dividing business semantics | Domain semantics drowned in technical details, code structure cannot reflect business models, long-term evolution difficult |
| **Microservice Anti-pattern**<br>Service division stems from technical boundaries, not semantic boundaries | Divide services by tech stack, deployment method, or team division | Understanding "microservices" as package splitting rather than bounded contexts | Service boundaries divorced from business semantics, massive "interface swamps", high coupling between services, high evolution costs |
| **Frontend Framework Rotation**<br>Obsessed with stack replacement, ignoring interaction semantics | Technical decisions center on React/Vue/Svelte choices | Thinking framework change = quality improvement | Interface layer kidnapped by implementation means, interaction semantics divorced from domain semantics, difficult to reuse |
| **Low-code Platform Proliferation**<br>Tools determine modeling | "Assemble" systems with drag-and-drop components and platform rules | Cognition degrades from "designing models" to "using templates" | System interpretability and flexibility lost, business evolution limited by platform capabilities, high long-term evolution costs |

------

#### 1.2.4 Philosophical and Architectural Warnings

- Philosophically: We see "tool phenomena" rather than "problem essence";
- Architecturally: Tool-first makes systems fall into implicit assumptions, losing active definition;
- Software interpretation theory reminds us:

  > **Interpret reality first, then choose tools.**
  > Tools serve architecture, not define architecture.

------

### 1.3. Core Idea: "To Exist is to be Distinguished"

In this article, the most important philosophical proposition is:

> **To exist is to be distinguished** (*To exist is to be distinguished*)

This is not metaphysics, but the foundation of software's birth.

When we say something "exists," it means we have already divided and named it in chaos, separating it from the undifferentiated whole.

This idea was proposed by George Spencer-Brown in *Laws of Form*:

> "To draw a distinction is to create a universe."
> Drawing a distinction creates a universe.

------

#### 1.3.1 Engineers unconsciously "distinguish" constantly:

- Defining a `User` table distinguishes "users" from the world;
- Dividing "login page" and "homepage" draws boundaries in user interaction space;
- Establishing bounded contexts gives concepts semantic boundaries;
- Distinguishing interfaces from implementations defines system structure and logical layers.

These actions are not technical accidents, but **philosophical necessities**:
Software engineering always reveals existence, shapes structure, and interprets the world through "distinction."

Of course, below is the complete section manuscript I wrote for Chapter 3, suggested to be placed after **3.3 "Core Idea: 'To Exist is to be Distinguished'"** or used as section 3.4ðŸ‘‡

---

#### 1.3.2 The Subjectivity of Distinction: Different Engineers, Different Worlds

"To exist is to be distinguished" does not mean this world is pre-given and naturally classified;
On the contrary, it emphasizes:

> **The world is not "out there," but manifests through the observer's distinctions.**

Each engineer's **way of distinguishing is different**, so the "system world" he "sees" is also different.

---

#### 1.3.3 Distinction Determines "What You See"

When a junior developer faces business problems, his "distinction" often stays at the technical surface:

* Pages / Interfaces / Data tables
* Controller / Service / Repository  
* Modules = Code folders

While a senior architect sees a completely different world:

* Domain objects / Aggregate roots / Semantic boundaries
* Events / Decisions / Process flows
* Bounded contexts and evolution trajectories

This shows that facing the same problem, they see two completely different "world structures."
The former sees technical forms, the latter sees domain logic and ontological structure.

---

#### 1.3.4 Distinction Level = Cognitive Level

The root of this difference lies not in tools, but in the depth of cognitive structure.

| Distinction Level | World Engineers "See" | Typical Characteristics |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Phenomenal Layer | Pages, interfaces, database tables | Emphasizes CRUD, focuses on appearance |
| Functional Layer | Modules, services, calls | Emphasizes responsibility division and dependencies |
| Language/Model Layer | Aggregates, contexts, domain models | Focuses on semantic stability and interpretability |
| Event Layer | Historical processes, causal chains, state evolution | Focuses on dynamic evolution and temporal dimension |
| Ontological/Distinction Layer | Distinctions, semantic boundaries, existential structure | Creates interpretability and system evolution space |

This shows that distinction ability itself is cognitive ability.
The depth of cognition determines how complex systems you can handle and how much uncertainty you can master.

---

#### 1.3.5 Engineering Collaboration Conflicts Are Essentially "Distinction Conflicts"

Common arguments in teams are actually not technical disagreements, but **inconsistent ways of distinguishing**:

* A thinks "service = microservice instance"
* B thinks "service = semantic boundary"
* A says "just split into two interfaces"
* B says "this involves bounded context division"

On the surface, this is an architectural solution disagreement,
But essentially, it's a conflict between two ways of dividing the "world."

If this conflict is not made explicit, teams will fall into a state of "surface agreement, but actually torn apart," unable to reach deep consensus in the long term.

---

#### 1.3.6 Ways of Distinction Can Be Trained and Evolved

Distinction is not an innate ability, but can be gradually evolved through training and practice:

* Junior engineers learn to "perceive phenomena" through CRUD
* Intermediate engineers learn to "divide functions" through modularization
* Senior engineers learn to "organize language" through DDD
* Architects actively construct an interpretive world through events and distinctions

> How you divide the world determines what kind of world you can create.

---

#### 1.3.7 Significance for Explicit Architecture

The core value of Explicit Architecture lies not in frameworks, but in forcing us to:

* Explicitly divide semantic boundaries
* Turn implicit architectural cognition into discussable, shareable, and evolvable structures
* Let teams share the same "interpretive power"

This also means:

> **The threshold for mastering Explicit Architecture is essentially a cognitive threshold, not a technical threshold.**

------

### 1.4. From Distinction to Architectural Evolution

Software does not appear as "architecture" from the beginning;
It evolves with the evolution of human understanding of the world.
From "interface-data" to explicit distinction ontological architecture, it has experienced **cognitive level transitions**.

| Level | Philosophical Foundation | Keywords | Interpretation Method | Engineering Manifestation |
|-------|-------------------------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Phenomenal Layer | Phenomenology (Husserl) | Appearance | Displaying the "image" of reality | Interface-driven development (UI First), prototypes, CRUD architecture |
| Functional Layer | Technical rationality | Abstraction | Breaking reality into functions and processes | Functional module division, MVC, Service layering |
| Language Layer | Philosophy of language / Ontology | Model | World manifests through concepts and language | DDD, bounded contexts, domain modeling |
| Event Layer | Hermeneutics | History | World presents as event flow | Event Sourcing, Event-driven Architecture |
| Ontological Layer | Spencer-Brown / Structuralism | Distinction | Constructing reality's boundaries through architectural distinction | Explicit Architecture, semantic boundary design |

------

#### 1.4.1 Phenomenal Layer: The "Image" of Reality

This layer is the cognitive starting point for most beginners and traditional software development.
We see a "phenomenon" - interface, page, function button, then "implement" it.

- UI â†’ Direct mapping to code;
- Business logic implicit in interface behavior;
- Taking "visible" reality as the source of truth.

**Typical representatives**: UI First development, form-driven CRUD systems.
**Limitations**: Cannot express temporality, context, and semantic boundaries, architecture lacks interpretability.

------

#### 1.4.2 Functional Layer: The Stage of Technical Rationality

Software begins to be understood as a combination of "functions."
This stage emphasizes layering, abstraction, and process-oriented thinking, attempting to manage complexity with rational technical means.

- Breaking interface behavior into Controller, Service, Repository;
- Architecture emphasizes "clear responsibilities," but business semantics remain implicit in functional implementation;
- Main goal is "engineering maintainability."

**Typical representatives**: MVC, three-layer architecture, traditional enterprise application architecture.
**Limitations**: Weak semantic modeling ability, interpretation of the real world stays at "what to do."

------

#### 1.4.3 Language Layer: World Manifesting Through Concepts

As software system complexity increases, mere functional decomposition is insufficient.
Engineers begin to use "**concepts**" to characterize domains and describe boundaries.

- Domain objects replace technical objects as the core;
- Bounded contexts clarify semantic boundaries;
- "Linguistic consistency" begins to appear within systems.

**Typical representatives**: DDD (Domain-Driven Design), semantic modeling, Context Map.
**Significance**: Engineers begin to use "language" as a tool to interpret the world, not just implement functions.

------

#### 1.4.4 Event Layer: World Unfolding in Time

The real world is not static, but presents as **event flow**.
At this layer, software begins to bind with time, causality, and history.

- State is no longer an object snapshot, but the result of event flow;
- Architecture shifts from synchronous "function calls" to asynchronous "event narratives";
- World interpretation becomes "what happened" rather than "what is now."

**Typical representatives**: Event Sourcing, Event-Driven Architecture, CQRS.
**Significance**: Software is no longer just a static mapping, but a kind of historical narrative.

------

#### 1.4.5 Ontological Layer: Constructing World Through Distinction

This layer is currently the pinnacle of cognition.
Software no longer just describes phenomena, implements functions, defines language, or records events, but:

> **Actively constructs reality's boundaries through explicit distinction**.

- Architecture becomes a "place of interpretation" rather than a "container of implementation";
- Systems gain self-interpretability through semantic layering and explicit boundaries;
- Domain concepts, event semantics, and technical implementation are completely separated.

**Typical representatives**: Explicit Architecture, semantically-driven architectural design, architecture as interpretation.
**Significance**: Engineers shift from "passively using tools" to "actively defining the world."

Most engineers' cognition stays at the MVC level, meaning their understanding of the software world is still a combination of "interface + data."
Only when cognition enters the "explicit distinction" level do they begin to truly shape the world's structure - this is also the part that AI currently finds difficult to replace: **AI can generate code, but cannot autonomously distinguish the world.**

------

### 1.5. The Goal of This Article

The purpose of this article is not to praise some technology or architecture, but to:

- Return to the philosophical starting point of software, explaining why it emerged;
- Reveal how the core idea of "to exist is to be distinguished" runs through engineering practice;
- Show the cognitive transition from MVC to Explicit Architecture;
- Help engineers regain the initiative to "interpret the world."

------

> **"What we truly write is not programs, but a structured interpretation of the world."**

------



## Chapter 2: Philosophical Background - Software is More Than Code

Contemporary software engineering teaching, tools, and practice often focus on languages, frameworks, processes, and delivery efficiency. However, if we only stay at these levels, we will miss a fundamental question:

> **"Where does software come from?"**

This is a question beyond tools and craftsmanship. It does not originate from the invention of a programming language, nor is it derived from a branch of computer science, but from humanity's basic impulse to **explain and organize the world in a formalized way**.

Software is not just "code that implements functions," but more like a **philosophical structured behavior**: through distinction, encoding, and organization, a certain appearance of the world can be reproduced, operated, and continuously iterated and refactored in formal systems.

------

### 2.1 From Philosophy to Engineering Thread

| Stage | Domain | Thought |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Existence | Metaphysics | Existence is not naturally manifest, requires subject revelation |
| Distinction | Spencer-Brown | Distinction is the starting point of form and existence |
| Information | Bateson / Shannon | Information is difference |
| Model | Ontological engineering | World is expressed through models |
| Architecture | DDD / Explicit Architecture | Software is structured world interpretation |

#### (1) Existence: World is Not "Self-Evident"

In metaphysics, "existence" is not like a stone quietly placed before our eyes, but needs to be "revealed." Our understanding of the world manifests through perception, language, and action. The foundation of software engineering lies precisely in this revelation:

- Requirements analysis is actually revealing a domain's way of existence;
- Designing architecture is giving this existence form and boundaries;
- Writing code is just the final explicit step.

#### (2) Distinction: The Starting Point of Form

Spencer-Brown proposed in *Laws of Form*: **"To exist is to be distinguished"** (To draw a distinction is to bring a universe into being).
Distinction is the starting point of all form:

- When we distinguish "user" from "system," an interactive universe is constructed;
- When we distinguish "order" from "payment," business structure begins to appear;
- When we distinguish "kernel" from "boundary," the embryo of architecture is born.

> Without distinction, there is no system; without boundaries, there is no architecture.

#### (3) Information: Difference is Meaning

Bateson, one of the founders of systems theory, cybernetics, anthropology, and cognitive science, gave the classic definition: "**Information is a difference that makes a difference**," and Shannon's formalized measurement of information both reveal the core of software engineering:
Software does not "copy the world," but extracts **meaningful differences** from the world through distinction and encoding, and stabilizes them in formal systems.

#### (4) Model: World Manifesting in Language and Structure

Modeling is not "restoring reality," but **reconstructing reality** in "language-concepts-relationships."

- UML is a modeling language;
- DDD distinguishes domains through Bounded Contexts;
- Ontological engineering focuses on how to accurately express world structure at the semantic level.

Models make the world "operable" and lay the foundation for the next step - architecture.

#### (5) Architecture: Structured Interpretation

Architecture is not decorative diagrams, nor just technology selection. It is our way of **interpreting the world through structure**.

- MVC is a worldview of "interface-data";
- Clean Architecture is a worldview of "dependency direction";
- DDD is a worldview of "domain and boundaries";
- Explicit Architecture attempts to make "interpretation" itself an explicit object.

Architecture is interpretation. It is not "implementing" some objective world, but creating a "runnable world" that has been distinguished, organized, and formalized.

------

### 2.2 Software as a Medium for "Interpreting the World"

Philosophically speaking, all human institutions, tools, and technologies are interpretations and organizations of the world. Software is even more a "formal strengthening" and "automated extension" of this interpretation.

- Requirements documents are "verbal interpretations of the world";
- Data structures are "skeletons of interpretation";
- Algorithms are "evolution rules of interpretation";
- The system running programs is the "concrete form of interpretation."

> **Software is an Executable Interpretation of the World**.

------

### 2.3 Cognitive Evolution: Distinction â†’ Information â†’ Model â†’ Architecture

1. **Distinction**: Humans first construct a "structured world" by distinguishing things;
2. **Information**: With distinction comes difference; difference carries information;
3. **Model**: Information is organized into structure, becoming abstractions that can be communicated and deduced;
4. **Architecture**: Models are institutionalized, formalized, and engineered into runnable systems.

This path is not a historical timeline, but a cognitive logic.
All software engineering activities occur along this path.

------

### 2.4 Why We Write Software

Humans write software not because of computers themselves, but because we hope to:

- **Distinguish** and organize the complex world;
- **Fix** and circulate differential information;
- **Formalize** model interpretations and make them reusable;
- **Transform** abstract worlds into structured, executable order.

In other words, what we write is not programs, but:

> **A structured interpretation of the world.**



## Chapter 3: The Philosophical Evolution of Software Architecture

*"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." â€” Wittgenstein*

### 3.1 Introduction: From Tools to Interpretation

In daily engineering contexts, we talk about languages, frameworks, APIs, and technology stacks; but at a deeper level, software is not only a construction tool, but also a **way of interpreting the world**.

We write code not just to "implement functions," but to **divide, model, linguistify, and eventize reality, ultimately creating an "ontological space" with internal logic**.

> Code and architecture are not just reflections of reality; they are structures through which we organize, understand, and even create the world.

Therefore, the history of software architecture is also a history of "transfer of interpretive power":

- From **mirroring reality** (mirror reality)
- To **functionalizing reality** (instrumentalize reality)
- To **linguistifying reality** (linguistic reality)
- **Eventizing reality** (historicized reality)
- Until **distinction-constructing reality** (ontological construction).

------

### 3.2 Philosophical Background: Levels of Interpretation

Phenomenology and hermeneutics tell us:
The world never manifests directly, but is revealed through some kind of "structure."
Software architecture is precisely a kind of "revealing structure" - it does not restore reality, but **makes reality manifest through some interpretation**.

| Level | Philosophical Foundation | Keywords | Interpretation Method |
|-------|-------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| Phenomenal Layer | Phenomenology (Husserl) | Appearance | Displaying the "image" of reality |
| Functional Layer | Technical rationality | Abstraction | Breaking reality into functions and processes |
| Language Layer | Philosophy of language / Ontology | Model | World manifests through concepts and language |
| Event Layer | Hermeneutics (Gadamer) | History | World presents as event flow |
| Ontological Layer | Spencer-Brown / Structuralism | Distinction | Constructing reality's boundaries through architectural distinction |

------

### 3.3 MVC: Mapping Reality (Phenomenal Layer)

Early MVC (Model-View-Controller) was a **phenomenal mapping** of reality.

- Reality was translated into data tables and interfaces.
- Logic only flows between View and Model.
- Controllers are just "pipes" without interpretive power.

Philosophically, this corresponds to Husserl's phenomenology: we operate only on phenomena, not things themselves.

ðŸ‘‰ For example, "order" in this architecture is just a database record and a form.
Software at this time is a **mirror**, passively reflecting reality.

------

### 3.4 Layered Architecture: Functionalizing Reality (Functional Layer)

As system scale grows, software is incorporated into "rational management" - forming classic layered architecture (UI / Service / Repository).

- Through technical rationality, complex reality is broken into controllable modules;
- The world is organized in a "factory-like" manner.

This corresponds to modern technical rationality: **reality is no longer understood, but controlled**.

ðŸ‘‰ Order in this architecture = Controller + Service + Repository.
Software is a **machine**, emphasizing maintainability and reusability.

------

### 3.5 DDD: Linguistifying and Ontologizing Reality (Ontological Layer)

Eric Evans' DDD (Domain-Driven Design) introduced a thorough paradigm shift:

> "The heart of complex software lies in the model, and the heart of the model lies in language."

- Software and domain experts share a common language (Ubiquitous Language);
- Bounded Contexts become interpretive boundaries;
- Language is not just description, but a way of defining reality.

Philosophically, this corresponds to Wittgenstein and Heidegger's thoughts:

> "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."
> "Being manifests through revelation."

ðŸ‘‰ Order is no longer data, but an Aggregate Root, carrying behavior and semantics.
Software becomes a **language system**, beginning to "dialogue" with reality.

------

### 3.6 Event Sourcing / CQRS: Eventizing Reality (Hermeneutic Layer)

Event Sourcing and CQRS further shift interpretation from "objects" to "history."

- State is no longer central, events become the atoms of the world.
- System interpretation focuses on "what happened" rather than "what is now."
- Software becomes an interpreter of historical trajectories.

This corresponds to Gadamer's hermeneutic thought: understanding is a "fusion of horizons," an interpretive process generated in historical flow.

ðŸ‘‰ The meaning of order lies not in its fields, but in its `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentReceived`, `OrderShipped`...
Software at this time is a **historical interpreter**.

------

### 3.7 Explicit Architecture: Distinguishing and Revealing Reality (Onto-Structural Layer)

When software enters "Explicit Architecture," it no longer relies on frameworks to secretly construct structure, but **constructs reality with distinction as first-class citizens**:

- Architecture itself is a formalized "distinction mechanism";
- Systems no longer "react" to reality, but **create an interpretive world** through distinction;
- Developers' role shifts from "using tools" to "designing existential boundaries."

This corresponds exactly to Spencer-Brown's assertion in *Laws of Form*:

> "To draw a distinction is to bring a world into being."

ðŸ‘‰ Order is no longer an implicit structure absorbed by frameworks, but an existential entity constructed by events, contexts, strategies, and rules together.
Software becomes a **constructor of existence**.

------

### 3.8 Summary of Philosophical Shifts

| Stage | Interpretation Method | Philosophical Foundation | Software Role |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| MVC | Mapping reality | Phenomenology | Mirror |
| Layered Architecture | Functional abstraction | Technical rationality | Factory |
| DDD | Linguistification | Ontology / Philosophy of language | Language system |
| Event Sourcing | Eventization | Hermeneutics | Historical interpreter |
| Explicit Architecture | Ontological distinction | Spencer-Brown Structuralism | Constructor of existence |

------

### 3.9 Summary: Architecture of Interpretation

Looking back at the evolution of software architecture, we can see a hidden but profound ideological thread:

> **Software evolves from "technical tool" to "structure for interpreting the world"**.

- **MVC**: World is a mapped mirror
- **Layered Architecture**: World is a rationalized machine
- **DDD**: World is a linguistically defined territory
- **Event Sourcing**: World is a history in progress
- **Explicit Architecture**: World is an ontological space that manifests through distinction

Architecture is not just a way of organizing code, but how we:

- Define "what exists" through distinction;
- Place understanding of reality in technology;
- Express "what the world is" through systems.

This is the philosophical evolution behind software architecture, and one of the core ideas of this article.



## Chapter 4: The Trap of Tool-First Approach and Cognitive Stagnation

> "Tools don't automatically bring understanding, frameworks can't think for you."
> "If you can't explain what you're doing, you're being dominated by tools, not using them."

### 4.1 Introduction: When Tools Obscure the World

In the modern software industry, technology changes much faster than cognitive updates.
Languages, frameworks, SDKs, and AI "silver bullets" emerge endlessly, yet we repeatedly see:

- Frameworks change generation after generation,
- Tools upgrade version after version,
- But software understanding methods and system structural awareness remain almost stagnant.

> Tool progress doesn't automatically bring cognitive evolution.
> Many engineering practices still stay at MVC cognition, just wrapping old thoughts with new tools.

------

### 4.2 Tool Worship: Being Shaped Rather Than Shaping

Software engineering practice is intensive, and therefore easily **mistakes "knowing how to use tools" for "mastering essence"**.

| Appearance | Essence |
|------------|---------|
| Proficient in using framework APIs | Doesn't mean understanding domain boundaries |
| Efficiently building CRUD interfaces | Doesn't represent modeling and abstraction capabilities |
| Mastering DevOps and CI/CD | Doesn't equal mastering system's ontological structure |
| Knowing how to prompt AI to generate code | Doesn't represent ability to master complex system evolution logic |

The consequences of this "tool worship":

> Engineers degenerate from "existential beings who create structure" to "operators shaped by tools."

They lose system "interpretive power" and architectural initiative; systems become more complex, but "cognitive maps" remain at the basic level.

------

### 4.3 The Universality and Consequences of MVC Cognitive Stagnation

Globally in the industry, **MVC cognitive stagnation** is most common. No matter how technology stacks change (React/Vue/Flutter/Spring/.NET/Laravel...), underlying thinking remains almost unchanged:

- Interface â†’ Business â†’ Database
- Events, models, contexts, semantics are all flattened into one layer of "controller logic"
- Domain and technology are not truly separated
- Architecture doesn't become "interpretive structure," just "tool puzzles"

ðŸ‘‰ Consequences are:

- **Systems difficult to evolve**: Business becomes complex, code becomes a swamp;
- **Difficult to reuse**: Without language and boundaries, there's no shared "semantic foundation";
- **AI difficult to amplify value**: Underlying structure is chaotic, amplifying chaos.

In this situation, no matter how much technology upgrades, it's just **"new skin" on old thinking**.

------

### 4.4 AI's Mirror Effect: Can Only Replace Tool-Layer Programmers

AI's emergence further exposes the problem.
AI doesn't understand system ontological structure, but excels at imitating and generating "tool-layer" code:

- Generate CRUD
- Write Service / Repository
- Automatically call SDK / API
- Fill in a bunch of "glue code" for you

ðŸ‘‰ If work only stays at "knowing how to use tools," the gap between humans and AI will approach zero.
AI may not "replace" programmers, but will **replace people stuck at the tool layer**.

> AI just illuminates the cognitive fault lines that already existed in the industry.
> It's not a "killer," just a "mirror."

------

### 4.5 Architectural Cognition is the Source of Engineering Creativity

What determines the upper limit of software engineering is not tools, but **cognitive structure**:

- Can divide domains and contexts
- Can build evolvable event semantics
- Can carry business rules through language
- Can reveal "what the system is" through architecture

Tools can accelerate, but **only cognition can pave the way**.
This cognition is what we mentioned in the previous chapter - the "interpretive power" from phenomena to distinction:

| Cognitive Level | Tool Performance | Creative Potential |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Tool Layer (MVC) | CRUD, page logic | Extremely low, easily replaced by AI |
| Functional Abstraction Layer | Module division, interface encapsulation | Limited, emphasizes implementation |
| Language/Model Layer | DDD, contexts, semantic expression | Medium-high, can interpret complex domains |
| Event/Structure Layer | Event Sourcing, explicit boundaries | High, can shape system evolution direction |

------

### 4.6 The Cost of Cognitive Stagnation: System Aphasia

When systems long stay at the tool layer, the biggest cost is not "maintenance difficulty," but:

- **Systems cannot express themselves**
  Without language models and semantic boundaries, business meaning can only be buried in code.
- **Teams cannot align understanding**
  Tools don't convey thought, only operations. Team members' understanding of systems relies entirely on local experience.
- **Evolution is led by tools**
  Not system structure determining the future, but tool ecosystems determining the future.

> When you use tools to interpret the world, you only see the world that tools allow you to see.
> When you use architecture to interpret the world, you have the power to define the world.

------

### 4.7 Summary: From Tool Users to Interpreters

The real watershed in software engineering is not mastering how many frameworks, but **whether one has the cognitive power to interpret reality and shape architecture**.

- Tools are just accelerators, cannot replace cognition.
- Frameworks are just implementation carriers, cannot become boundaries of thinking.
- AI is just a mirror, reflecting the industry's cognitive stagnation.

> **Tools can make you walk faster, but only cognition can determine where you're going.**

This chapter points out a fact long masked by technological halo:
**Most people in software engineering are not eliminated by technology, but trapped by their own cognitive limitations at the tool layer.**



## Chapter 5: Cognitive Levels and Programmers' Worldview

> "You're not writing code, you're using code to interpret the world."
> "How you understand the world determines how you build systems."

### 5.1 Introduction: Technical Ability â‰  Engineering Cognition

The software industry often equates "good programmers" with "technical proficiency":

- Language mastery
- Framework proficiency
- Tool familiarity
- Quick to get started

But in reality, we often see this kind of difference:

- Using the same Java / Spring / React,
  Some can only build a CRUD;
  Others can build a flexible, evolvable business platform.
- Both doing "project development,"
  Some get stuck in functional assembly;
  Others can abstract a stable domain model.

The essence of this difference lies not in **technology stack**, but in **cognitive level**.

> A programmer's cognitive approach determines how he understands problems, builds boundaries, organizes architecture, and reserves evolution space.

------

### 5.2 Five Levels of Cognition: From Phenomena to Ontology

In the previous chapter we mentioned that the evolution of software architecture is essentially the evolution of "interpretive structure."
Correspondingly, programmers' understanding of the world can also be described with a clear philosophical layering:

| Level | Philosophical Foundation | Keywords | Interpretation Method | Programmer Characteristics |
|-------|-------------------------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Phenomenal Layer | Phenomenology (Husserl) | Appearance | Displaying the "image" of reality | Translating requirements directly into interfaces and databases; staying at tool surface |
| Functional Layer | Technical rationality | Abstraction | Breaking into functions and processes | Focusing on module division, process control; implementation-centered |
| Language Layer | Philosophy of language / Ontology | Model | World manifests through concepts and language | Focusing on domain modeling, building shared language and semantics; can stably handle complexity |
| Event Layer | Hermeneutics | History | World presents as event flow | Focusing on processes and evolution; can make systems tell their own "stories" |
| Ontological Layer | Spencer-Brown / Structuralism | Distinction | Constructing reality's boundaries through architectural distinction | Using architecture as medium to construct world; capable of designing interpretive structures and evolution mechanisms |

------

### 5.3 Phenomenal Layer: Treating the World as "Interface and Data"

**Typical characteristics**:

- Only see UI and databases
- Understanding "functions" as "pages + interfaces + data tables"
- All logic hidden in Controllers and Services
- Dependent on frameworks, lacking modeling language

**Engineering consequences**:

- Extremely high system coupling
- One requirement change affects everything
- Cannot extend, cannot evolve
- Extremely easily replaced by AI

> "They write code, but don't understand the world behind the code."

------

### 5.4 Functional Layer: Treating the World as "Processes and Modules"

**Typical characteristics**:

- Focus on modules, layering, responsibility division
- Know some abstraction and encapsulation
- Use design patterns to improve maintainability
- System structure is "functionally stacked"

**Engineering consequences**:

- System is slightly more organized than CRUD, but structure still lacks "language"
- Cannot well carry complex domain logic
- Extensibility still highly depends on "human memory" and "documentation"

> "They understand structure in tools, not the world in structure."

------

### 5.5 Language Layer: Treating the World as "Domain and Semantics"

**Typical characteristics**:

- Use DDD, bounded contexts
- Share common language with domain experts
- Translate complex business structures into models
- Systems begin to have "interpretability"

**Engineering consequences**:

- System structure can evolve sustainably
- New team members can understand systems through language
- Engineering efficiency improvement doesn't depend on "personal experience"

> "They don't just write code, they use language to interpret the world."

------

### 5.6 Event Layer: Treating the World as "History and Process"

**Typical characteristics**:

- Use event sourcing, CQRS
- Focus on "what happened" rather than just "what state is"
- Understand systems as "event flows"
- Systems have "self-narrative ability"

**Engineering consequences**:

- Systems better adapt to change
- Can capture dynamic evolution of reality
- Can align with real world's temporal structure

> "They don't just interpret the world, but can record how the world is interpreted."

------

### 5.7 Ontological Layer: Treating the World as "Distinction and Existential Structure"

**Typical characteristics**:

- Use architecture as first principle, explicitly express domain boundaries
- Design systems as "interpretive structures"
- Create world through distinction
- Language, events, semantics are all incorporated into "structure"

**Engineering consequences**:

- Architecture is language, architecture is rules
- System evolution doesn't depend on specific individuals
- Engineers have ability to "define existence"

> "They're not implementing systems, but **constructing the world of systems**."

------

### 5.8 Cognitive Level Differences and Engineering Results

| Cognitive Level | Typical Performance | Engineering Output | AI Replacement Risk |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Phenomenal Layer | CRUD, interface-oriented, framework-driven | Quick delivery but not evolvable | Extremely high |
| Functional Layer | Process abstraction, pattern stacking | Maintainable but loose structure | High |
| Language Layer | Clear models and semantics, clear domains | Extensible, shareable, interpretable | Medium |
| Event Layer | Historical flow and behavioral logic | Evolvable, with temporal dimension | Low |
| Ontological Layer | Structure defines world | Self-describing, self-evolving, high-resilience architecture | Extremely low |

ðŸ‘‰ This is why in the same industry, some engineers just stack functions, while others **define the future of systems**.

------

### 5.9 The Essence of Cognitive Transition: From "Implementation" to "Interpretation"

Cognitive level improvement is not skill point accumulation, but **worldview transformation**:

- From "writing code to implement requirements" â†’ to "interpreting the world through code"
- From "using tools" â†’ to "designing structure"
- From "following architecture" â†’ to "creating architecture"

This is exactly the ideological thread we've been emphasizing in previous chapters:

> **Software architecture is not a technical choice, but a cognitive structure.**
> Cognition determines structure, structure determines evolution.

------

### 5.10 Summary: Becoming Programmers Who Interpret the World

In software engineering, technology always changes, but cognitive layering is extremely stable.
Those who can truly traverse technological waves are not people who master more tools, but those who can elevate cognitive levels:

- Phenomenal layer stays at tools
- Functional layer pursues efficiency
- Language layer has understanding
- Event layer understands evolution
- Ontological layer defines structure

> "It's not how complex the world is, but how high a level you can use to interpret it."
> "The essence of architecture is the projection of cognition."



## Chapter 6: Path and Methods of Cognitive Transition

> "Cognitive transition is the necessary path for software engineers from tool users to world interpreters."

The goal of this chapter is: **to provide programmers with a clear path to elevate cognition from phenomenal layer, functional layer step by step to language layer, event layer, and even ontological layer.**
We will expand from three dimensions: theoretical foundation, methodological path, and practical strategies.

------

### 6.1 Overall Path: From Tool Layer to Ontological Layer

The core of cognitive transition is **from implementation to interpretation**, summarized as follows:

| Starting Level | Target Level | Core Transition Point |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Phenomenal Layer | Functional Layer | From interface/data-oriented â†’ functional and responsibility decomposition |
| Functional Layer | Language Layer | From modules and processes â†’ building shared semantic models |
| Language Layer | Event Layer | From static models â†’ focusing on behavior and event flow |
| Event Layer | Ontological Layer | From event interpretation â†’ building explicit architectural distinction |

> Each transition is a **cognitive mode upgrade**: not skill point stacking, but worldview transformation.

------

### 6.2 From Phenomenal Layer to Functional Layer: Tool-Driven â†’ Functional Decomposition

**Goal**: Understand software as systematic structure, not just pages and interfaces.

**Practical Methods**:

1. **Responsibility-Driven Design**
   - Break systems into modules with clear responsibilities: Service, Repository, UI.
   - Understand dependencies between modules, not just focus on CRUD implementation.
2. **Process Modeling**
   - Use UML or flowcharts to transform business processes into operable processes.
   - Identify bottlenecks, responsibility boundaries, and boundary conditions.
3. **Architectural Semantic Awareness**
   - Realize that architectural design serves future extensibility, not just current functionality.

**Engineering Benefits**:

- Clear modules, clear responsibilities
- Reduced system maintenance costs
- Initial abstraction ability for complex systems

> The transition at this stage is to transform programmers from "implementers" to "architectural thinkers."

------

### 6.3 From Functional Layer to Language Layer: Module Stacking â†’ Models and Semantics

**Goal**: Build shared language, let system structure carry real semantics.

**Practical Methods**:

1. **Introduce Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
   - Clarify Bounded Contexts
   - Define Aggregate Roots, entities, and value objects
   - Collaborate with domain experts to establish Ubiquitous Language
2. **Abstract Concept Modeling**
   - Build not only data models, but also behavioral models
   - Map real-world concepts to software objects
3. **Model-Driven Development**
   - Prioritize model integrity over technical details
   - Let models guide code structure, not be limited by frameworks

**Engineering Benefits**:

- System structure synchronizes with business semantics
- Team collaboration efficiency greatly improves
- Interpretability of complex business significantly enhances

> This transition makes software a "language system for interpreting the world."

------

### 6.4 From Language Layer to Event Layer: Static Models â†’ Behavior and History

**Goal**: Let systems not only describe world state, but also describe what happened in the world.

**Practical Methods**:

1. **Introduce Event Sourcing**
   - Model with event flow rather than final state
   - Every business operation produces traceable events
2. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - Separate write operations from read operations
   - Strengthen distinction between behavior and results
3. **Historical and Temporal Sense Modeling**
   - Systems understand behavior sequences, timelines, and state evolution
   - Analyze, audit, and replay through event flow

**Engineering Benefits**:

- Systems can trace history, have "self-narrative ability"
- Complex business logic can be verified and tracked
- System evolution closely aligns with business development

> The transition at this stage transforms programmers from "static modelers" to "historical interpreters."

------

### 6.5 From Event Layer to Ontological Layer: Event Interpretation â†’ Explicit Distinction

**Goal**: Let software architecture become a means of "constructing the world."

**Practical Methods**:

1. **Explicit Distinction (Explicit Architecture)**
   - All aggregates, boundaries, strategies, and rules are explicitly defined
   - Architectural structure itself expresses ontological boundaries and logic
2. **Formalized Architectural Principles**
   - Use architectural specifications, constraints, and contracts to clarify system behavior
   - Let system semantics not depend on personal understanding or implicit rules
3. **Migration from Models to Structure**
   - Let models, events, and rules be "seen" in architecture
   - Systems become "ontological spaces" for interpretation and evolution

**Engineering Benefits**:

- Systems can self-describe and self-evolve
- Engineering decisions don't depend on personal memory
- High-complexity systems can still maintain interpretability and resilience

> At the ontological layer, programmers don't just "solve problems," but **create structures for interpreting the world**.

------

### 6.6 Practical Strategies for Cognitive Transition

1. **Extract Thinking from Projects**
   - Regularly reflect on "what worldview does the system express"
   - Focus not just on implementation, but on interpretive ability
2. **Continuous Philosophical Reading**
   - Ontology, phenomenology, philosophy of language, hermeneutics
   - Build thinking frameworks, understand cognitive levels
3. **Cross-Level Practice**
   - Practice modeling, eventizing, and explicit distinction simultaneously in one project
   - Small-step experimentation, from language to events to ontological layer
4. **Team Collaboration Training**
   - Let everyone understand semantics behind models
   - Build shared cognition, ensure architecture becomes projection of team cognition

------

### 6.7 Summary: The Core of Transition

Cognitive transition is not learning more tools, but **worldview upgrade**:

1. **Phenomenal Layer â†’ Functional Layer**: Tool users â†’ Functional module designers
2. **Functional Layer â†’ Language Layer**: Functional module designers â†’ Domain modelers
3. **Language Layer â†’ Event Layer**: Domain modelers â†’ Historical interpreters
4. **Event Layer â†’ Ontological Layer**: Historical interpreters â†’ Architectural existential constructors

> **The true creativity of software architecture lies not in tools, but in cognition.**
> Only when cognition transitions to the ontological layer can programmers make systems become **engines for interpreting the world**.



## Chapter 7: The Value, Competencies, and Cognitive Transition of Explicit Architecture

### 7.1 Introduction: From Tools to Constructors of Existence

In the previous chapters, we discussed the philosophical foundation of software, architectural evolution, and cognitive levels, and also revealed the trap of "tool-first" approach and the consequences of programmers' cognitive stagnation. At this point, developers face a key question:

> **How to make software architecture truly become an engine of interpretive power and creativity?**

Explicit Architecture provides the answer. It is not just a set of technical methods, but a **cognitive training and ontological practice**. Through it, software development is no longer just functional implementation, but a **structured interpretation** of the world.

------

### 7.2 Why Choose Explicit Architecture

1. **Explicit Distinction, Interpretable Architecture**
   - In Explicit Architecture, every aggregate, event, context, and rule is clearly defined.
   - Architecture doesn't rely on implicit conventions or framework "magic," system logic and boundaries are transparent to developers and teams.
2. **Architecture as Interpretive Power**
   - Software no longer just reflects reality, but **constructs a world that can be understood and operated** through distinction, modeling, and event flow.
   - Developers shift from "using tools" to "designing existential boundaries," achieving **return of interpretive power**.
3. **System Evolvability and Anti-fragility**
   - Explicit architecture makes systems more adaptable to requirement changes, business evolution, and technical updates.
   - Clear boundaries, traceable events, teams can continuously iterate without destroying core models.
4. **Creativity and Engineering Capability Enhancement**
   - Software development shifts from implementing functions to **creating structured worlds**.
   - Developers can abstract complex business into models, event flows, and decision structures, achieving transition from tool-driven to thinking-driven.

------

### 7.3 Competencies Developers Need

Practicing Explicit Architecture requires not only technical ability, but also cognitive and philosophical competencies:

| Competency Dimension | Content | Significance for Explicit Architecture |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Philosophical Cognition | Existence, distinction, models, events | Understanding software as a medium for interpreting the world, not just implementation tools |
| Abstract Modeling Ability | Aggregate roots, bounded contexts, event flows, strategies | Abstracting business into structured models, avoiding tool kidnapping |
| Engineering Practice | Architectural design, event management, rule expression | Ensuring system evolvability and interpretability |
| Collaboration and Shared Semantics | Team Ubiquitous Language, domain communication | Ensuring consistent understanding and operability of models across teams |
| Reflective Perspective | Positive feedback between cognition and practice | Enhancing cognitive competencies through practicing Explicit Architecture, which in turn determines practice ability |

------

### 7.4 Long-term Practice: Cognition and Brain Shaping

Neuroscience shows that the human brain has **neuroplasticity**, and long-term high-level cognitive training can reshape brain structure and function. The practice process of Explicit Architecture is precisely this kind of cognitive training:

1. **Systematic Thinking Enhancement**
   - Simultaneously managing aggregate boundaries, event flows, strategy rules, and context relationships
   - Strengthening prefrontal cortex and parietal region circuits
2. **Abstract Concept and Pattern Recognition Improvement**
   - Abstracting real business into models and event flows
   - Optimizing temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex, enhancing cross-domain thinking ability
3. **Multi-level Cognitive Development**
   - Multi-layer training from phenomena â†’ function â†’ language â†’ events â†’ ontology
   - Optimizing collaboration between Default Mode Network (DMN) and Executive Control Network (ECN), improving working memory and reflective ability
4. **Metacognition and Decision-making Enhancement**
   - Reflection on architectural choices, boundary division, event strategies
   - Enhanced prefrontal metacognitive region function, improved ability to predict complex system evolution
5. **Creativity and Problem-solving Enhancement**
   - Left-right brain integration: logical analysis + creativity
   - Rapid generation of structured solutions, not relying on experience or templates

> **Positive feedback loop**: Cognitive competencies determine practice level, and practicing Explicit Architecture in turn enhances cognitive competencies, which is exactly the embodiment of the principle of reflexivity.

------

### 7.5 Value Difficult for AI to Replace

- The core of Explicit Architecture lies in **multi-level, reflexively enhanced understanding**:
  - Identifying business patterns, defining boundaries, planning event flows, constructing interpretable architecture
- These abilities cannot be simply replaced by coding or data processing, so developers who persistently practice Explicit Architecture remain irreplaceable in the AI era.

------

### 7.6 Summary and Action Guide

1. **Recognize Value**
   - Explicit Architecture is not just a technical method, but a philosophical practice and cognitive training.
   - It shifts software development from tool-driven to interpretive power-driven.
2. **Develop Competencies**
   - Possess philosophical cognition, abstract modeling, engineering practice, team collaboration ability, and reflective perspective.
3. **Long-term Practice**
   - Every project is a cognitive training ground, strengthening systematic thinking, pattern recognition, metacognition, and creativity through practice.
4. **Harvest and Outlook**
   - Architecture as ontological construction: you're not just writing software, but **designing the structure of the world**.
   - Explicit Architecture makes developers "constructors of existence," elevating software engineering to the height of philosophy and cognition.

> **Practicing Explicit Architecture is not just building software systems, but forging the mental structure for understanding the world.**

## Chapter 8: What Project Managers Should Recognize

This is a very critical issue that many technical evangelists tend to overlook.

Although this article is mainly written for **developers and architects**, it actually has profound value for **Project Managers (PM)** as well.
â€”Even to say that project managers are the "organizational leverage point" that determines whether a team has the opportunity to practice **Explicit Architecture**.

---

### 8.1 Strategic Level: From "Stacking Functions" to "Interpretation and Evolution"

Traditional project management often revolves around schedules, feature points, and burn-down charts, resulting in:

* Projects easily fall into a "patchwork" state;
* Difficulty adapting to requirement changes;
* Technical debt rapidly inflates over time;
* Engineering teams lose active design power, becoming "function factories."

And this article hopes to make PMs understand:

> Software systems are not stacks of function lists, but **interpretive structures** of business reality.

This means:

* Early architectural design in projects is actually the shaping of business cognition;
* Clear distinction and modeling can make systems more evolvable;
* No longer relying on "changing frameworks" to "save projects."

**Value for Project Managers**:

* Can understand the strategic significance of architectural decisions, no longer just focusing on short-term delivery;
* Improve projects' **long-term maintainability and change resilience**;
* Reduce refactoring and rework costs, improve ROI.

---

### 8.2 Cognitive Synergy Level: Let Teams Have a Common "Worldview"

The essence of Explicit Architecture is not technology, but:

> Let team members reach consensus on "how to distinguish the world."

In a typical software project, PMs, products, development, and testing often speak different languages:

* "Order" is a user experience for products;
* For development, it's a database record;
* For testing, it's a string of use case numbers;
* For project management, it's a milestone.

This "semantic tearing" is one of the root causes of software project chaos.

Through Explicit Architecture:

* Business concepts are linguistified and ontologized;
* Boundaries are clear, responsibilities are distinct;
* Everyone's understanding of the system can **converge to a unified structure**.

**Value for Project Managers**:

* Communication costs significantly decrease;
* Requirement changes no longer "affect everything with one move";
* Teams can form **stable and self-consistent collaboration language** (Ubiquitous Language).

This allows PMs to truly "coordinate" rather than "putting out fires between parties."

---

### 8.3 Project Implementation Level: Reducing Uncertainty, Improving Controllability

In traditional tool-dominated development models:

* Code structure implies business assumptions;
* Architecture depends on a core developer's "mental model";
* PMs have extremely limited control over project status.

The core characteristics of Explicit Architecture are:

* Architectural distinction and business semantics are explicit;
* Decision boundaries are clear;
* System structure can be understood externally, not just existing in a developer's mind.

**Value for Project Managers**:

* Easier to grasp the real source of project complexity;
* Convenient for managing human resources and progress (because system boundaries are more stable);
* Reduce "cognitive gaps" caused by personnel turnover and handovers;
* Improve projects' **predictability and risk resistance**.

---

### 8.4 Organizational Upgrade Level: Make Technical Strategy Truly Serve Business

Many PMs encounter this dilemma:

> "I know technology is important, but I can't clearly explain what strategic value it has for business."

Explicit Architecture exactly solves this disconnect:

* It provides a method to directly correspond **business worldview â†’ engineering structure**;
* This mapping doesn't depend on frameworks and won't collapse due to technology stack changes;
* Makes technical architecture a "central nervous system" supporting business evolution, not a stumbling block.

**Value for Project Managers**:

* Can more confidently discuss technical strategy with senior management;
* Form **clear engineering asset views**, not just a pile of function backlogs;
* Help teams escape the vicious cycle of "short-sighted development" and "constantly starting over."

---

### 8.5 Summary: 5 Major Values of Explicit Architecture for PMs

| Dimension | Traditional Mode | Explicit Architecture | Benefits for PMs |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Strategy | Function stacking, relying on people | Architecture carries interpretive power, reduces refactoring | Improve ROI, reduce ineffective iterations |
| Cognitive Synergy | Multi-party semantic tearing | Unified language and distinction | Reduce communication costs |
| Project Implementation | Uncontrollable status | Explicit architectural structure | Improve progress controllability |
| Personnel Turnover and Evolution | Mental models â†’ high dependency | Explicit models â†’ low dependency | Reduce handover risks |
| Technical Strategy Value Communication | Unquantifiable | Business-technology integration | Let PMs truly stand on the same strategic level as technology |

---

**One-sentence summary for PMs:**

> This is not an article about "philosophy," but a strategic guide to help you "control complex software projects."
> Explicit Architecture can help you **foresee risks earlier, implement projects more steadily, and fall into chaos less**,
> Let teams' technology and business **speak the same language**.
